My solutions for [Ãœbersetzterbau (compiler development)](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/andi/185A48)
SS2022 at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.at/en/).

You should be able to compile each solution with a simple `make all` inside the directory. However, they were only ever tested on the Linux boxes provided by the lecture which had the following installed: `gcc`, `flex`, `yacc`, `ox`, `bfe` and `iburg`.

There is a sperate repository with plenty of testcases at [flofriday/UEB-Testsuite](https://github.com/flofriday/UEB-Testsuite).
